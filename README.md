Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 
 
Data analysis from a data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover some market trends.

• Using conditional formatting depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live,
•	Calculation of Percent Funded in which can see how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal,
• Calculation of Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average,
• Calculation of Category at Q and another called Sub-Category, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts,
• Pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category,
•	Pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table you have created,
•	Pivot table that will analyze how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category,
•	Pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table you have created.
•	The dates stored within the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps. Fortunately for us, there is a formula that can be used to convert these timestamps to a normal date,
•	Creation a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of state, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of state, and filters based on parent category and Years,
•	Creation a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table,

Creation a report in Microsoft Word and answer the following questions.
1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

•	Counting how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed above. Populate the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns with this data.
•	Added up each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
•	Creation a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.
•	Creation a new worksheet in your workbook, and create a column each for the number of backers of successful campaigns and unsuccessful campaigns.
 
•	Evaluation for unsuccessful campaigns:
o	The mean number of backers.
o	The median number of backers.
o	The minimum number of backers.
o	The maximum number of backers.
o	The variance of the number of backers.
o	The standard deviation of the number of backers.
